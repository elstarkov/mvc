This repo was made and developed during the course MVC, spring 2023. It's a website made with PHP in the framework
Symfony. It contains articles and statistics about Agenda 2030, an analyze about unit testing, a card game and
a library. As you can see it contains a little bit of everything. If you navigate through the website you can find
more information about the modules and techniques behind every route written in Swedish.

This is the Scrutinizer badges. They show how well each part is performing. The code coverage is a bit misleading
because all parts of the website is not tested. I have focused on the ones relevant to the card game and show of
statistics. I found them most important. Click any of the badges for more info.
